# Worldcore Audio

Worldcore is a 3D entity-management system for Croquet. It is modular, extensible, and cross-platform.

You can use it to build multiuser webapps with hundreds or thousands of dynamic objects:

* 3D multiplayer games
* Multiuser AR & VR
* Shared visual simulations

This package contains the **audio component** for Worldcore. It extends [the Worldcore kernal] with [Resonance spatial audio](https://resonance-audio.github.io/resonance-audio/) to allow Worldcore object to play 3D sounds.
