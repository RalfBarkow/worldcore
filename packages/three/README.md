# Worldcore Three

Worldcore is a 3D game engine for Croquet. It is modular, extensible, and cross-platform.

You can use it to build multiuser webapps with hundreds or thousands of dynamic objects:

* 3D multiplayer games
* Multiuser AR & VR
* Shared visual simulations

This package contains the **three component** for Worldcore. It extends the Worldcore kernel with the [three.js rendering engine](https://threejs.org/). Use it to render Worldcore objects in 3D using the three.js renderer.
